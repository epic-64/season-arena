We are building a browser game.
It plays like a mix of Shakes & Fidget (turn-based, precomputed combat),
Final Fantasy 12 (gambit system), and Path of Exile (skill tree, loot).

The backend is written in modern Kotlin, using Ktor for the web server.
The frontend is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using no frameworks or libraries.
We are however relying on JSDoc to improve the developer experience.
Also, all JavaScript modules are based on ESM.
